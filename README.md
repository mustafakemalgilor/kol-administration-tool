# Knight online server administration interface

This is a large project I've worked on in the past. It allows to manage users connected to gameserver in real-time. Also, it provides useful statistics about the game's current state. Although it is functional in some parts, it is far from being completed. The most useful functionality which I can be able to recall is to track user information in real-time. This allows an administrator to monitor user's information (stats, hp, mp, experience, location, inventory, chat window etc.).

This project also consist a small utility named ItemSearchEngine, which is a graphical tool for searching and easily locating items by given criteria. It uses item*.tbl files as data input.

You'll need DevExpress components to build and use this project.
